# Edge Impulse support for RISC-V based ESP32-C3
 
Add this ```https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_dev_index.json``` to the preferences section on your Arduino IDE to get the target board ESP32-C3 Dev Module in the boards section.

Then run the [static buffer](https://github.com/arijitdas123student/esp32c3-ei/blob/master/ESP32-C3-Motion_inferencing/examples/static_buffer/static_buffer.ino) script.

> This works with macOS and Linux only as of now. Windows terminates us with errors. Feel free to raise a PR if you're able to make this work on WSL/Windows.
